TypeScript tutorial for beginners: what is TypeScript?
The definition from the official website says: "a typed superset of JavaScript" but it assumes you know what a "superset" is and what "typed" means. Instead to keep things simple you can think of TypeScript as of "a layer on top" of JavaScript.

TypeScript is a layer because you can write TypeScript code in your editor. After a compilation all that TypeScript stuff is gone and you're left with plain, simple JavaScript.

If the idea of a compilation step confuses you keep in mind that JavaScript is already compiled and then interpreted. There is a JavaScript engine that reads and executes your code.

But JavaScript engines are not able to read TypeScript code so any TypeScript file should go under a "pre-translation" process, called compilation. Only after the first compilation step you're left with pure JavaScript code, ready to run in a browser. You'll see later how the TypeScript compilation is done.

For now let's keep in mind that TypeScript is a special kind of JavaScript but it needs a "translator" before running in a browser.

TypeScript tutorial for beginners: why TypeScript?
At first you won't understand exactly why TypeScript makes sense, after all it gets stripped down before becoming JavaScript code. "What's the point of TypeScript" you'll ask. That's a good question my friend.

In reality you'll see its benefits as soon as it will catch serious and silly mistakes in your code. More important your codebase will become well structured and almost self-documenting. You'll also appreciate improved autocompletion in your editor but that's just a nice side effect.

Anyway, every now and then a new thread pops up on Twitter or on the "orange website" saying that TypeScript is useless (the TypeScript tax) or too awkward.

As with almost everything in IT there are partisans on both sides of the barricade. There are detractors and proponents for TypeScript but what matters is that TypeScript is a solid tool and having it in your tool belt won't make harm.

My goal here is to show the tool and help you forming your own idea on TypeScript.
